Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This project is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.  The project has 5 milestones to complete before the implementation is considered adequate for distribution.

**A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned:**

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence, and the other(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. The aim of the project is to utilize the new skills taught during the AI Core Bootcamp course. Through this project, I learned valuable lessons in programming, problem-solving, and game development. It allowed me to apply the concepts and techniques acquired during the course to create an engaging and interactive game, enhancing my overall programming skills and knowledge.

Hangman Game information 
------------------------------------
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word.   If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player (computer) writes it in all its correct positions. 
If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player removes (or alternatively, adds) one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. 
Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.

The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.   If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player(computer)  may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram.
