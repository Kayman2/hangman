Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This project is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.  The project has 5 milestones to complete before the implementation is considered adequate for distribution.

Certainly, here's a description of your Hangman project experience:

**Project Description:**
The Hangman.py project is a text-based implementation of the classic word guessing game, Hangman. The project aims to create an interactive game where a player attempts to guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of lives, and with each incorrect guess, a life is deducted. The game continues until the player either successfully guesses the word or runs out of lives.

**Aim of the Project:**
The primary goal of the Hangman.py project was to create a functional and entertaining Python program that simulates the Hangman game. This project provided an opportunity to apply programming concepts such as classes, methods, loops, and conditional statements in a practical context. It aimed to challenge the player's word-guessing skills while providing an enjoyable gaming experience.

**Learning Experience:**
The Hangman.py project was an insightful learning experience. It allowed for the application of object-oriented programming principles by structuring the game logic into a class. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** I learned how to design a class, define attributes, and create methods that interact with those attributes. The Hangman class served as an excellent example of encapsulation and abstraction.

2. **Conditional Statements:** The game's logic heavily relied on conditional statements to determine whether a guess was correct, whether the game was won or lost, and whether a guess was valid.

3. **Loops:** The project used loops to repeatedly prompt the player for guesses and ensure the game continued until a win or loss condition was met.

4. **Error Handling:** I had to implement error handling to ensure that user inputs were valid. For example, I checked if a guess was a single alphabetical character and whether it had already been guessed.

**Challenges Faced:**
During the development of Hangman.py, I encountered a few challenges. The primary challenges were related to documentation and time management. It's crucial to document code effectively to make it more understandable and maintainable, and this is a skill that takes practice. Time management was also essential, as I needed to allocate enough time to complete the project without rushing.

**Enjoyment and Future Improvement:**
Despite the challenges, I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of creating Hangman.py. It provided an excellent opportunity to apply and reinforce programming concepts. In the future, I intend to address my weaknesses, particularly in documentation and time management, to improve the quality of my code and project execution. I look forward to undertaking more projects that continue to expand my programming skills and knowledge.

Hangman Game information 
------------------------------------
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word.   If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player (computer) writes it in all its correct positions. 
If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player removes (or alternatively, adds) one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. 
Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.

The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.   If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the other player(computer)  may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram.
